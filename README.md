# Verilog-Example-Codes
This is a list with various combinational and sequential circuits written in Verilog. 

PLEASE ONLY PROVIDE PROPERLY WRITTEN CODES AND THEIR TESTBENCH FILES.

HOW TO CONTRIBUTE?
1) Make a folder in the codes directory with the circuit name. 
2) Add the verilog and testbench file.
3) Make a PR

Other ways to contribute-

a)Make the Readme better

b)Add a github.io site for the repository

c)Inform others about this to others

d)Add tutorials on verilog and combinational/sequential circuits

e)Give a brief explanation of various circuits. For example, add a readme about 4_bit_ripple_carry_adder which has its working and a diagram of it.

f)Adding RTL Schematics to all circuits
